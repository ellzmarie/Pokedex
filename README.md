# Pokedex

I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was... at making a Pokémon manager (a Pokédex).

My Pokédex is a full CRUD App with the following prerequisites:

* JavaScript
* Node / Express
* HTML / CSS

I was given a pokemon.js file that has all the raw data for 151 Pokémon (it's over 50,000 lines of code). I rendered this as JSON in my browser. My app will:

* display a bunch of Pokémon images on the index
* have separate show pages for each Pokémon, accessible by clicking on a Pokémon's image on the index page
* have the ability to add a new Pokémon
* have the ability to edit existing Pokémon
* have the ability to delete Pokémon
* have some styling
